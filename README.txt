This code is for creating a phylogeny tree in a binary tree format using an entered distance matrix
you can find the implementation part of getting a newick tree format in the SRC directory named UPGMA
After that, the output will be used in the Pointer_based_tree_implementation file to construct a binary tree from this string


for running a demo, you can use the entered distance matrix in the file.
The formatted output that should be got is written in a comment to guide you

For more info about the code, please read the attached report in the DOC directory.
